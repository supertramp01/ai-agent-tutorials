# AI Agent Tutorials

This is course which lasts around 4 weeks which enables students to build fully functional AI Agentic apps that integrates:

- Multiple agent frameworks (Google ADK, CrewAI)
- Custom tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Cloud-hosted FastMCP servers
- Real-world actions like Google Calendar operations
- RAG pipelines & observability
- Frontend integration with Replit

Students will also get familiar with commercial agentic platforms

Pre-requisites and requirements for the course
1. Recommend using Github Code Spaces
2. Use of Serper Dev (use free api key from serper.dev)
3. Use Google Calenadar API Services
4. Use FastMCP Cloud
5. Anthropic Claude Desktop
6. Free version of Replit or equivalent AI Tool
